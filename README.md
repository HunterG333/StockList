# Stock List
A watchlist app to track the market and a selection of stocks
## Description
A webapp designed to simplify the investing and trading experience. Users can add stocks to their watchlist to easily monitor real time updates.
## Getting Started
I might host this on the web at some point but for now i'm broke and don't want to pay for webhosting. Self-hosting will be good enough for now
### Installing
Clone the project and open it in an IDE of your choice. Configure application.properties to connect to a relational database of your choice. I can only guarentee that PostgreSQL will work though.
You will then need to set the environemnt variables for the API keys that are used in the APIController class.
### Executing the program
Start the program from your IDE to confirm there are no errors. You can then build it as you see fit.
